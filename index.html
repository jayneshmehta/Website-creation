         on their own schedule and at their own pace.</p>
         <p class="sectionTag text-small">Schools and institutions that offer online learning are also increasing in number. Students pursuing degrees via the online approach 
           must be selective to ensure that their coursework is done through a respected and credentialed institution.
           The quantity of distance learning and online degrees in most disciplines is large and increasing rapidly.</p>
